# Lesson 3: Control Structures

Control the flow of your program with logic.

## Key Concepts

1.  **`if` / `else`**: Standard conditional logic. Parentheses `()` around the condition are optional, but curly braces `{}` are required.
2.  **`for`**: The only loop in Go.
    *   Standard: `for init; condition; post { ... }`
    *   While-style: `for condition { ... }`
    *   Infinite: `for { ... }` (break out with `break`)
3.  **`switch`**: A cleaner way to write multiple `if/else` statements. No `break` is needed at the end of each case (it's automatic).

## How to Run

```bash
go run main.go
```

# Lesson 1: Hello World

Welcome to your first Go program!

## Key Concepts

1.  **`package main`**: This line tells the Go compiler that this file should compile as an executable program rather than a shared library.
2.  **`import "fmt"`**: This imports the `fmt` (format) package, which contains functions for formatting text, including printing to the console.
3.  **`func main()`**: This is the entry point of the program. When you run the program, the code inside this function is executed.

## How to Run

Open your terminal in this directory and run:

```bash
go run main.go
```

You should see `Hello, World!` printed to the screen.

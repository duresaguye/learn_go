# Project: Number Guessing Game

A simple game to practice control flow.

## How it Works

1.  The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.
2.  It asks you to guess the number.
3.  If your guess is too high or too low, it gives you a hint.
4.  The loop continues until you guess correctly.

## Concepts Used

*   `math/rand`: Generating random numbers.
*   `bufio`: Reading user input from the console.
*   `strconv`: Converting strings (input) to integers.
*   `for` loop: Repeating the game logic.
*   `if/else`: Checking the guess.

## How to Run

```bash
go run main.go
```
